# Skewed Data Generator for TPC-H: 
This is a simple modification of the TPC-H data generator to generate skewed data. Microsoft Research had generously made their version of skewed data generator available for download [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52430). But, it supports only Windows. I simply modified their code to support linux environments. To refer to the original readme, look into Original-Readme.txt
  
*Disclaimer: I do not own any part of this generator and this is just an attempt to share a simple modification of the original code for easy portability to linux environments. If you have any issues with this being public, please let me know.*
